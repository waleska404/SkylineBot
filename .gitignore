# To ignore a set of files, wildcards can be used, as can be seen above.
# A sole '*' will ignore everything in your folder, including your .gitignore file.
# To exclude specific files when using wildcards, negate them.
# So they are excluded from the ignore list:
!.gitignore 

# Use the backslash as escape character to ignore files with a hash (#)
# (supported since 1.6.2.1)
